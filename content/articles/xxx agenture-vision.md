# Vision of Agenture

Agenture is reflection of my vision to where AI is going in the industry. 

There are very few, very large companies are taking the market. LLM builders, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and few builders of tools, like Cursor, Sierra, Glean etc. These companies will dominate the market. To address variety of business cases they will need to rely on third party vendors, who build specifalized solutions (agents). I believe there is a need for a software that helps to integration of agents into companies infrastructure.

Things like: 
- intergartion with tools and systems;
- interoperability with other agents
- centralized management of agents
- controlling work quality
- billing and cost management

## Scenarios which I'm thinking about:

### Enterprise search and reporting

Hyatt signs contract with OpenAI to use ChatGPT for their enterprise. The typical tasks are like:
- search for information in the sharepoint and confluence
- generate reports from the data on snowflake and other datasources
- answer questions by searching across available datasources and summarizing the results

There can be two scenarious:

1. ChatGPT becomes so smart, that it can do all the tasks by itself. In this case what's left for third-party vendors is just integration of IT systems with OpenAI. And Most likely OpenAI will build connectors with most of enterprise systems and platforms.

2. ChatGPT is not smart enough to cover all variety of use cases, and needs to use tools to do the tasks. This opens an opprtunity for third-party vendors to build tools that can be used by ChatGPT.
