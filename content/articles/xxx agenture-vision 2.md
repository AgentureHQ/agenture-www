# Vision of Agenture


## My use cases

### Supervising agents work quality

We have number of agents serving enterprise. One of them is responsible for searching enterprise documentation and generating business reports. Another is monitoring enterprise infrastructure and alerting on issues. There are some agents serving other use cases. 
The common problem is that agents work quality requires supervision. 
Drawing analogy with human workers:
- Human worker going through training, then operates following standard operating procedures. 
- Supervisor periodically checks if worker is following procedures. 
- Human worker is rewarded for good work and punished for bad work. 
- Human worker is given feedback on their work.
- Human worker is given training on how to improve their work.

How we control quality of work done by AI agents?

========== STOP READING BELOW THIS LINE =========

Orchestration, control, monitoring, tuning, and governance for AI agentic mesh.

What it does? It helps to automate complex tasks by orchestrating multiple agents. Additionally it provides infrastructure components for AI agents.


## Background
Here we provide use cases illustrating pain points Agenture will solve. 
What is it?
For enterprise: A place where enterprize users can deploy and manage AI agents.
For AI agent vendors: A place where AI agent vendors can publish and sell their agents.

Dry list of features:
<!-- - Agent marketplace
- Agent deployment
- Agent management
- Agent monitoring
- Agent billing
- Agent security
- Agent governance
- Agent collaboration
- Agent interoperability -->



Use cases in form of stories:

Hyatt has internal enterprise chatbot to find information across the enterprise. 
The agent was built by a third party vendor. Platform team is integrating agent into their platform.

Hyatt is now looking to adopt more agents to help with other tasks. They are looking for a vendor that can help them build and deploy agents.







# Agenture: AI Agents Hub

AI agents on the raise for automating business operations at enterprises. Given variety of use cases we will see great amount of agents specializing in different tasks. As a next stesp we foresee a need for agents to collaborate with each other to perform complex tasks. Additionally, agents will require common supporting infrastructure, such as governance, security, safety and quality monitoring. 

Agenture aims to address these needs, and serve as "operating system for AI agents".

## Features

### Interoperability
- **Interoperability**: Enable seamless communication through standardized protocols:
  - **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**
  - **A2I (Agent-to-Infrastructure)**
  - **I2A (Infrastructure-to-Agent)**

### Governance
- **Unified Governance**: Centralized management of compliance, security, and operational oversight of all integrated AI agents.
- **Secure Integration**: Simplified and secure integration of AI agents into enterprise IT infrastructure.
- **Quality Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring, reliability checks, and performance analytics of AI agents.

### For AI Agent Vendors
- **Plug-n-Play Integration**: Standardized integration protocols enabling easy deployment into enterprise environments.
- **Governance and Security Standards**: Adherence to unified security, compliance, and governance requirements.
- **Billing and Payments**: Transparent and standardized payment processing and billing mechanisms.
- **Operational Monitoring**: Access to consistent monitoring, logging, and performance analytics.
- **Marketplace Visibility**: Ability to easily publish and market AI agents to enterprises.
- **Revenue Generation**: Monetize AI agents through a reliable and scalable platform.
- **Standardized Interoperability**: Seamless integration and communication facilitated by standardized protocols (A2A, A2I, I2A).

## Gaps and Next Steps
To strengthen the proposal, consider:
- Clearly defining example scenarios and use-cases illustrating typical business processes that would benefit from Agenture.
- Elaborating on specific compliance frameworks and security measures (e.g., SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA).
- Detailing technology stack or infrastructure architecture of the proposed solution.
- Outlining the initial strategy for onboarding enterprises and AI agent vendors.
- Establishing an initial target market segment and customer persona to refine marketing and outreach strategies.
