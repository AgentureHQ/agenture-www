============
# Agenture: AI Agents Hub

AI agents on the raise for automating business operations at enterprises. Given variety of use cases we will see great amount of agents specializing in different tasks. As a next stesp we foresee a need for agents to collaborate with each other to perform complex tasks. Additionally, agents will require common supporting infrastructure, such as governance, security, safety and quality monitoring. 

Agenture aims to address these needs, and serve as "operating system for AI agents".

## Features

### Interoperability

  - **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**
  - **A2I (Agent-to-Infrastructure)**
  - **I2A (Infrastructure-to-Agent)**

### Governance
- **Unified Governance**: Centralized management of compliance, security, and operational oversight of all integrated AI agents.
- **Secure Integration**: Simplified and secure integration of AI agents into enterprise IT infrastructure.
- **Quality Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring, reliability checks, and performance analytics of AI agents.

### For AI Agent Vendors
- **Plug-n-Play Integration**: Standardized integration protocols enabling easy deployment into enterprise environments.
- **Governance and Security Standards**: Adherence to unified security, compliance, and governance requirements.
- **Billing and Payments**: Transparent and standardized payment processing and billing mechanisms.
- **Operational Monitoring**: Access to consistent monitoring, logging, and performance analytics.
- **Marketplace Visibility**: Ability to easily publish and market AI agents to enterprises.
- **Revenue Generation**: Monetize AI agents through a reliable and scalable platform.
- **Standardized Interoperability**: Seamless integration and communication facilitated by standardized protocols (A2A, A2I, I2A).

## Gaps and Next Steps
To strengthen the proposal, consider:
- Clearly defining example scenarios and use-cases illustrating typical business processes that would benefit from Agenture.
- Elaborating on specific compliance frameworks and security measures (e.g., SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA).
- Detailing technology stack or infrastructure architecture of the proposed solution.
- Outlining the initial strategy for onboarding enterprises and AI agent vendors.
- Establishing an initial target market segment and customer persona to refine marketing and outreach strategies.
